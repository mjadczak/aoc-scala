# Advent of Code 2021, in Scala 3

These are my solutions to the [AoC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in [Scala 3](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/overview.html).
They're both a way to showcase some nice features of Scala, and an excuse for me to try out the new shiny things in Scala 3.

I am aiming to solve each part of each day in isolation; in particular, I have not taken the opportunity to abstract common parts between part 1 and 2 of each day (even though there are usually plenty). I may do this in the future, but for now one should expect code duplication between the parts.
